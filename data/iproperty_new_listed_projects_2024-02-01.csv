Serambi Villa is a collection of 41 luxurious residences nestled in Kajang's largest township. These multi-generational homes feature Semi D & Bungalow units with a distinctive architectural design that exudes a sense of home

Serambi Villa by S P Setia consists of semi-detached and bungalow units with breathtaking views, and a distinctive design inspired by tropical architecture that exudes a sense of home.

Here are 4 reasons why you should make Serambi Villa your dream home:

1) It’s by the lakeside

Serambi Villa homes are actually located by the beautiful Lake of Reflection, a 10-acre wetland featuring water pavilions and meandering trails inspired by lush tropical wetlands.

There’s a pair of swings for children to play near the lake and a waterfront featuring a waterfall surrounded by nature’s landscape. Walking trails culminate in a beautiful wildlife-inspired point called Pulau Pelangi, whilst just a stone’s throw away are recreational parks like The Lawn and Canal Park, which are perfect for light workouts like biking or jogging.

2) Guarded community

You’ll always be safe in the vicinity of Serambi Villa. The vicinity is a guarded community designed in a serene environment to provide the residents with peace-of-mind living.

3) Spacious homes with four to five bedrooms

There is nothing more precious than spending quality times with loved ones. All units come with spacious interiors, ample windows for natural light, and four to five bedrooms equipped with en-suite bathrooms.

Multigenerational families can live together under one roof, in perfect harmony, at Serambi Villa. There is enough room for grandparents, parents, children, and great-grandchildren to hang out and bond every day.

4) Strategic location

Serambi Villa is strategically located at Setia Alamsari, a wholesome 775-acre township with a multitude of conveniences like highways, schools, higher education institutions, shopping malls, public and private hospitals, golf courses, and public transportation within short driving distance.

This township has the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) KTM Komuter train station and highways such as the KL-Seremban, Kajang-Seremban and Kajang SILK within its vicinity, and is highly connected to the rest of Greater Kuala Lumpur. It is also located close to Bangi Gateway, Lotus’s Semenyih, Ecohill Walk and IOI City Mall, ensuring shopping conveniences every day.

Families looking to relocate to Setia Alamsari will be pleased to know there are various credible educational institutions nearby, from preschools to higher-learning establishments.

Key educational organisations include Sekolah Rendah Sri Al-Amin Bangi, Rafflesia International School, the German-Malaysian Institute and UKM.
